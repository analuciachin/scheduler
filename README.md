# Interview Scheduler

Interview Scheduler is a project from the Web development bootcamp curriculum. It is a single page application that allows the students to book and manage interviews with a mentor. Appointments can be made between noon and 5pm for each day of the week. The front-end of the application was built in React (with Hooks) by the students and the back-end was built using Node, Express and Postgresql and was already provided to us.
